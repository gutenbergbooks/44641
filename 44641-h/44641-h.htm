<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>M<small>OST</small> of the verses in this little volume were conceived and written, if
not quite finished, at the time of Cronje’s surrender at Paardeberg.</p>

<p>A certain doubt, however, as to any message of theirs, though modestly
set off by a belief in their polemic and literary value, has, I think
now, unduly delayed their advent into the crowded world of print; and,
though the present juncture of a heralded, but, by no means, perfected
peace, be perhaps not a very opportune moment for their publication, I
have yet thought well to give them forth; the more, since what so be the
outcome of the negotiations pending, and whichsoever be the motive of
the stronger party thereto&mdash;whether a bitter, though slowly realized
necessity, or, a trick of pure heart, or, say, tardy insight and
charity, both&mdash;be this as it may&mdash;the long, though fruitless attempt on
England’s part to compel<a name="page_vi" id="page_vi"></a> a surrender by the South African republics of
their political existence, illustrating and upholding, as no modern
exhibition of this kind has done, how rampant is still in Man, and
collective Man especially, a tacit faith in the bigger fist, or,
euphemistically speaking, the predatory law of nature&mdash;this, I repeat
it, can never, it seems to me, be sufficiently reprehended; and a hearty
condemnation of it may, therefore, fitly form the theme of
conscientious, if necessarily, censorious verse: with which contention
the following pieces are frankly submitted, even at this late day of a
stupendous struggle of moral Right&mdash;whatsoever its intellectual grounds
and equipment&mdash;against an aggressive and overweening Might, whose
partial defence allowed, rests, after all, and as already maintained,
its wider base on purely material force, on that callous and objective
expediency, which History, in her account of human odds, evermore
reveals, and, far too often, glaringly condones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, May, 1902.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the above was set down, Peace has at last gone forth, and of a
pace with the better<a name="page_vii" id="page_vii"></a> drift and traditions of England; but even so,
there seems no valid ground why these Lyrics should not be heard, as an
exponent in brief&mdash;inadequate, if you like, yet human no less&mdash;of a, for
a long time, not to be forgotten broil, if, indeed, the sad imp of
Contention has had his last say about it.</p>

<p>November, 1902.</p>

<span class="i0">Somewhere to the Moonward, or Sunward, so to speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A span or two to Eastward, then Southward by a streak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was heard to blare of tomtom a shameless epic wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At fancy of some Lion who had whisked his blooming tail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plumb thro’ a nest of hornets, nor never dreamt the hive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had such a trick to mind him how were that tail alive.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seems the skies were blathering while every wind-god swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pities would have curdled to hear the Beastie roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All offered salve and comfort, said never done was Wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some requiting Themis should venge it to her song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should smite the pesting dwarfies and heal the giant’s bruise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See paw and toothie peak not for lack of worthy use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, O, the strain fell whopping to thunder&mdash;drip of sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lamb-like lyric slopping its pace with bleary ruth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, in sober last, an epic, outworking thro’ the fact,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through blaze of hostile numbers, its own and bitter act.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it shook us to the Westward&mdash;a touch of kin and near&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We banged our shoppy hatches: we had a right to hear.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And this&mdash;yes, this, was the song of the Sorrowful True,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He, and that cherub of rowdy fist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’ll blithely shake it where erst he kissed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That covered Holy, the unctuous Wrong&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his blushing bouncer, St. Meek, the Strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set jointly down (while in crafty doubt<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bared hide and heart of the stalking lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its bluff and cant to their dismal core&mdash;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set down, I say, to mock-halcyon cheers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, with knife at throat of the suckling years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bled the weans, lest with peaceful bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, for other virtues in hiding there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods, who winnow all mortal stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should nurse the goats while they weed the flock&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let for lack of pasture the true herd pine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all for what? For a humping quibble on Mine and Thine!<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, lest Rue, the babbler, with saucy dare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should sit in judgment twixt Foul and Fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should slaver worse, if she came of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With inglorious snivel wise Clio’s page:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest all of this, with what sousing tact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They niced her the diverse of whim and fact;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How glowed their zeal as they raked the Rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke font and tablet and put her through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such drench of penance and convert-course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such Christian baptism from Truth, the Source:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure text nor ritual made never doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seasoned clerks, as with wary snout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each subtle wealsman stood sly at bay:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well&mdash;this was the Song of the Sorrowful True:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rip of a Muse&mdash;but it gives her view.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such pithy halves as outspeak the Whole:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Dawn that ’woke this train of songs&mdash;each simple lay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowering, then, and stirring hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ’cross those dim fields passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where History, gathering ghostly flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erst flush with life, now chill and gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would bind them fair, their story tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent bloom Death loves so well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, haply show, how from their seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What large effects may leveling breed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That Dawn has sped&mdash;trite Day knows all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roistering winds that ravening blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ceased their brawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad sport that drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War’s winged hounds, and harpies flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanned foul the airs and thicked their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each heave at bouts with throttling Death.<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the din there rose, I thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave strains of man no fear might toss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, echoing these, a few I wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into rude posies, strove to cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wildness with the rose of art,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! they were such slips as throws the heart,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grafts tongue on thought; here grew to breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those clear-felt notes not theirs to choose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, humbly, while their love did wreathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passioned chaplet for the Muse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did they, to match her large faith there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vie the crown she auguring bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not weave as well, to extol her sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sister garland for the Truth?<br /></span>
